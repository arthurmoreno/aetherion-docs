Aetherion: The Cosmic Engine
============================

Welcome to the official documentation for **Aetherion**, a game engine designed to bridge the gap between classic and modern sandbox simulations. Inspired by titles like *Tibia*, *Terraria*, *Minecraft*, *Dwarf Fortress*, and *Valheim*, Aetherion offers a unique blend of 2D physics and deep world simulation.

Overview
--------

<Put an example of the Aetherion engine in action here, such as a screenshot or a video link.>

Aetherion is built upon the principles of:

- **Tibia-like Physics**: Emulating the classic 2D physics system, providing a familiar yet enhanced experience.
- **Advanced World Simulation**: Incorporating features like dynamic water physics and environmental interactions, akin to *Dwarf Fortress*.
- **Entity-Component-System Architecture**: Leveraging the power of EnTT for efficient and flexible game object management.
- **Modular Rendering**: While defaulting to a 2D top-down perspective, Aetherion supports alternative rendering strategies, including 3D views.:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
